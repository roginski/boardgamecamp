I wrote this script to help by friends in boardgame camp orgnization.
Script accepts list of camp participant and create .csv that contain all boardgames participants owns. Then we usually import it to google docs for further edit.
It is done by crawling over participant profiles on http://tesera.ru. 
Running script takes some space on disk to store intermediate results!

TODO: would be nice to have hrefs to boardgames pages in result list.
