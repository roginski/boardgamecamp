I wrote this script to help my friends in boardgame camp organization.
Script accepts list of camp participant and create .csv that contains all boardgames participants owns. Then we usually import it to google sheets for further edit.
It is done by crawling over participant profiles on http://tesera.ru. 
Running script takes some space on disk to store intermediate results!
